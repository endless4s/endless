endless
=======

endless is a Scala library to describe event sourced entities using tagless-final algebras, running with built-in implementations for Akka.

@@@ note
*endless* refers to persistence and the ever flowing stream of events capturing state evolution with ES, and is a nod to *tag-less*.
